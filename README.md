## Filmians (mock IMDb application)

This project is written in TypeScript with Next and styled components.

API is sourced from [TheMovieDatabase](https://www.themoviedb.org). It is a closed sourced yet totally free (for non-commercial purpose) and extremely resourceful and popular database.

Note:
This project is the very first one with multipages I made with Next. Along journey, I gradually grasping the essence of Next and the reason for its popularity. Yet, there are lots still needed to be refactor and rethink to make it proper. Here is my apology.

Further updates will be listed below.
